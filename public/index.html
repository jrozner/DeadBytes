          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>You've found me! My name is Joe Rozner and I'm an entrepreneurial software engineer and computer security enthusiast located in Los Angeles, California.</p>
          <p>I try to live on the bleeding edge of technology, evaluating and adopting it early by incorporating it into small side projects and hacks. I've competed in local hackfests where I've built proof of concept collaboration tools and a real time game platform using Ruby on Rails and NodeJS; both of which heavily utilized new additions to HTML 5/CSS 3 including websockets, the file API, and drag and drop.</p>
          <p>My interest in security started at a young age when I discovered I was much better at taking things apart than putting them back together. I do independent research, vulnerability assessment, and regularly compete in Capture the Flag competitions. Since 2010 I have organized, designed, and run the <a href="https://www.defcon.org">DEFCON</a> Open Capture the Flag contest and competed in it prior as a contestant. I was a participant in the first <a href="https://workforce.cisecurity.org/">United States Cyber Challenge</a> and involved in starting and training the team to compete in the <a href="http://www.wrccdc.org">Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition</a> from my university. I place a strong focus on secure programming practices, developing secure software, and have created and run training sessions on secure programming techniques for individuals and businesses.</p>
